Agenda:

1) Confirm Quorum
2) Secretary
3) PyBind11
4) OpenPRs
5) VDB Visualize SOP


1) Confirm Quorum

Quorum is present.

2) Secretary

Secretary is Nick Avramoussis.

3) PyBind11

Nick has sent an email outlining the proposed work. All agree with Dan that the
work can be incrementally completed. A feature/pybind11 branch exists for the
target of this work. Nick to post as a Github Issue. The feature branch is to
be kept in sync on subsequent releases of OpenVDB.

4) Open PRs

Deprecating StringGrids: All approve but should wait for Kens approval too.

TBB 2021: Nick, incomplete CI. Majority agree that this should not hold up this
work. Jeff, already downstreamed some of it into Houdini. Nick to merge. We
can release a new (minor) version of VDB with this support. This needs approval
from Ken and we should discussing the versioning required.

EXR 3 (no PR, related to a proposed TBB release): How we bump VDB with the TBB
2021 changes is sort of related to how we would release a new version with 
EXR 3 support. All agree that the path of least resistance is to make EXR 
support in the command line tool optional, then add support for EXR 3. There's
still a question about the VFX platform's 2022 versioning if we don't support
it before EOY.

hsvtorgb: AX PR adding color conversion methods. Rich, tested against VEX's 
implementation which seems to clamp inputs going from hsv to rgb. Jeff, hue is
most likely wrapped and saturation is clamped. Nick to make these changes.

Counting Tools: Dan, ran into some issues with g++ AX builds exceeding memory
limits. Fixed by forcing the CI to build on one thread. PR needs approval.

CMake variable for Houdini DSOs: Dan, needs approval. There were issues with
proposed alternatives (building individual targets with makefiles) so Nick 
agrees this proposal is fine. One outstanding point was the fact that there
are two CMake variables which are attempting to achieve the same thing. The
first is documented at the top of the Houdini CMakeLists.txt file and turns
off nodes. Dan's new system turns nodes on. Ideally we would have a single 
variable which supported both. Nick, a regex string would be good. 
Introducing this new system is not ideal as it stands but can be improved
in the future.

Grain size dynamic node manager: Still no clear path forward here.

5) VDB Visualize SOP

Dan has parallelized some of the geometry construction from the VDB visualize
SOP. Points from voxels is now much faster. Sold + wireframe generation is not
parallelized. As part of this, Dan has removed lots of old compile time logic
specific to SESI/DWA. Dan, also trying to add slicing support, a common feature
done as a post processes to visualize a slice of a VDB. Jeff, this can be a
pain due to relative bounds moving or absolute index coordinates changing over
a frame range. Nick, solves this by clipping the input geometry though this
isn't the exact same solution as it needs a bounds to define the slice. Dan to
experiment with some solutions.
